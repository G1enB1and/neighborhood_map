Internet connection required.  

## Features:
This app uses Google Maps and Foursquare APIs to provide a map with markers  
to coffeeshop locations in Dallas, TX. Photo's provided by Foursquare appear
in an info window when selected. The list of locations can be filtered using  
a text box above the list. Map markers use custom icons and animations.  
Selecting a location via the list highlights the corresponding location on the  
map and opens it's info window. Selecting a location via it's map marker  
highlights its corresponding title in the list. Clicking the map deselects  
everything. The list can be toggled closed or open. The design is responsive  
and mobile first.  

## Specifications:
I used knockoutJS Model View ViewModel to separate concerns. JQuery and  
standard javascript were also used along with html and css. JSON data was  
fetched asynchronously from Foursquare API and Google Maps API.
